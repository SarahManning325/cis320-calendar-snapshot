# cis320-calendar-snapshot

Rough outline for the programming piece:
- Build a basic extension for testing.
- Build a tool for grabbing the image of the current screen.
  - (opt.) Check for plain text as well, but this might not be applicable in many cases.
- Build a tool for grabbing text from image (using Tesseract).
  - Sort through text for event info.
- Build a tool for creating and downloading .ics files to the user's file system.
  - Fill the .ics file with info from image.
  - Add the ability to check/fix event information before downloading.
- Bug testing and user feedback starts (iterates through the rest of this process).
- User-friendliness functionality changes (based on bug testing feedback).
- Visual design changes.
- Consider additional functionality if time allows:
  - Allow uploading of already-created image files.
  - Add cross-browser compatibility.
  - Create a professional-looking website to "advertise" the product.
- Extra-extra functionality:
  - See if there is a way to automatically import the .ics files to a calendar.
  - Consider other methods of using the product (through the website, as a downloadable application, etc.)
